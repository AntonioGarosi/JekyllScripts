# JekyllScripts
BASH scripts to simplify the adoption of Jekyll.

The script isn't fully coded and tested yet, but in case you want to try it, remember to:
* Clone you GithubPages to the Jekyll destination folder
* Change the REPO variable to your destination folder
* Give execution permits to the script via terminal with the command: sudo chmod +x jekyll-scripts.sh
